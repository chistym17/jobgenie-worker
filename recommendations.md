Thought: I have now retrieved the job recommendations using the fetch_recommendations tool. I must now transform this data into the specific JSON format requested. This involves iterating through the list of `ScoredPoint` objects, extracting relevant information from the `payload` and `content` fields, and constructing a JSON object for each job with the required fields, then assembling them into a JSON array. The Match Score should also be correctly formatted.
