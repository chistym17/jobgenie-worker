- title: Senior Full-Stack MERN Developer (React / Node / JavaScript)
- company: Orbital Installation Technologies, LLC.
- company_description: Orbital Installation Technologies is a leading provider of expert mobile installation services for fleet technology across the United States. Since 2006, we've been the go-to installer for GPS, IoT, ELD, RFID, dashcam, and other advanced fleet systems, trusted by top technology suppliers and operators. Our team specializes in high-quality, on-site installs — keeping fleets connected, compliant, and operational with minimal downtime.
- location: Remote
- type: Contract or Full-Time
- posted_date: 9 days ago
- salary: $50,000 - $74,999 USD
- description: We’re looking for a senior-level full-stack dev who knows the MERN stack inside out and is still very much in the code.
This isn’t a management role. You’ll be contributing directly — writing code, shaping architecture, and helping us build out real product features. You’ll work closely with our IT technical team. You’ll have a voice in decisions, but we expect you to ship and stay hands-on.
What You’ll Be Working On:
We’re building a modern workforce management platform for field service teams — real-world use cases like install tracking, dispatch, mobile work orders, photo verification, etc. It’s not a toy app or another dashboard overlay — we’re solving actual ops problems with a lean team and strong stack.
- stack: ['React (Context API, moving toward modularization)', 'Node.js + Express', 'MongoDB', 'REST APIs', 'AWS (Lambda, S3, etc.)']
- requirements: ['Strong experience with React, Node.js, MongoDB', 'You’ve shipped production MERN apps before — full cycle, not just small pieces', 'Comfortable designing API routes, data models, and component structure', 'Clean, maintainable code and good git hygiene', 'You’re opinionated about architecture but not religious — you know trade-offs', 'Comfortable working async and remote — you don’t need hand-holding']
- bonus: ['Experience with AWS (Lambda, CloudFront, S3, etc.)', 'React Native or mobile-first development experience', 'Integration with third-party APIs (auth, maps, OCR, image validation, etc.)']
- not: ['Not an agency request', 'Not a “review PRs and delegate” role', 'Not a team lead / manager position']
- how_to_apply: ['A link to your GitHub or portfolio (real work, not tutorial clones)', "What you're best at, and what kind of problems you like solving", 'Your availability and rate (hourly or monthly)', 'Optional: something in JavaScript that drives you nuts and how you deal with it']
